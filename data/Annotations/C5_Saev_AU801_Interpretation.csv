Quiet breathing inspirations for beginnings of phrases (bassline)

	The melodic themes have pickup note, while accompaniment usually sounds on the following downbeat. AU801 shows a pattern of inspiring BEFORE accompaniment/bassline downbeats. Alignment consistent at the beginnings of phrases, not with measure or every sounded note.
	m 9, 13, 37 (w/ solo cello), sympathetic
	m 41, 57, 61, 85 when contrabass play on downbeats
	m 48, when accompaniment begins a measure early relative to melody (cued by trumpet) 

This preparatory inspiration is absent at most equivalent moments that have downbeat-marking accompaniments without the bassline playing: m 21, 25, 29, 33, 73

And this audience member's inspirations shift to precede the pickup when the basses parts take up the melody: mm 88.75 and 80.75 (though this last is disrupted breathing see below). 

Inspiring before 4 bar phrases discontinues for much of the later part of the piece, when the bass parts are playing almost continuously (few rests). For example at m 92.75 and m 97.0 (though seems to have aligned breath AFTER passage at m 98.25) and m 108.75.

Still one moment highlighted in the interview, when the basses play have descending runs, does happen to show inspiration before the phrase begins (m 101).

2. Besides these persistent alignments of quiet breathing inspiration to salient musical structure, there are also instances when this audience member's deviations from stable quiet breathing also align substantively with performance-experience relevant moments: 
	m 63.25 Trumpet call cue for bass parts finally getting the melody. AU801 takes being inspiration (augmented, reset style) right after the trumpet call begins, and then is braced for phrase beginning, with little breaths preceding sf at at 67.0
	m 80.125 trumpet call again cue for basses as part of TUTTI melody (in eighths). Atypical inspiration timed for preparing to play melody, followed by very long post expiration pause through this interval. ACC shows lateral displacement (change in posture) preparing this entry as well.   
	m 105.75 sneak breath (shape disrupted) during double dotted quarter in tutti fanfar after long passage without break. Very rational place for brass player to routinely sneak extra air for the closing fanfares.
	m 113 after the music ends, AU801 takes big augmented breath, just like performing windplayers do to relax and reset their respiratory system after having to exert sustained control. 

I haven't calculated the probability of this alignment yet, but its not very likely to happen by chance. While these alignments coincide with relatively stable phrase lengths, breath-to-breath variation would normally disrupt this recurring phrase-onset pattern. I would also assume the participant would be unaware of breathing in alignment with the music, particularly during quiet breathing.
